    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "Before initiating the installation process of the GADME pipeline, it's crucial to ensure that your computing environment meets the following prerequisites:\n",
    "- **Python**: You should have Python version 3.10 or higher installed on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation Steps\n",
    "The GADME pipeline can be installed using either of the two methods: via Conda with Pip, or using Poetry. Select the method that best suits your preference and follow the corresponding steps below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Conda and Pip\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Conda Environment**: Begin by setting up a dedicated environment for GADME. This is a best practice to manage dependencies and avoid potential conflicts with other packages in your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   conda create -n gadme python=3.10\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   After the environment is successfully created, activate it:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   conda activate gadme\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install GADME**: Proceed with cloning the GADME repository and installing the package in editable mode. This approach is beneficial as it allows any modifications you make to the GADME code to be reflected immediately without the need for reinstallation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git clone https://github.com/DBD-research-group/GADME.git\n",
    "   cd GADME\n",
    "   pip install -e .\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Poetry\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clone the Repository**: Start with cloning the GADME repository to your local machine and navigate to the cloned directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git clone https://github.com/DBD-research-group/GADME.git\n",
    "   cd GADME\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Configure Poetry**: Prepare the project for Poetry by renaming the `pyproject.poetry` file to `pyproject.toml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   mv pyproject.poetry pyproject.toml\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Install Dependencies and Activate Environment**: Install all the necessary dependencies with Poetry and then activate the Poetry shell environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   poetry install\n",
    "   poetry shell\n",
    "   ```"
